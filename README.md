# Indivdual Assignment 1



## Project Description
This is my frist individual project in the front end semester. I chose a book as my product to display. You can see information about the book and its price. I was thinking that this website is a store where it only sells special eddition cover books, such is the one that i chose. 


## Navigation 
When entering the page you will see the product right away and you can scroll down to see more information about the product. When you click on the basket you will enter the form site where you will add your contact information. it is not responsive yet as it has no js function.
